## Chord Speller

#### Introduction

**Title**: Chord Speller

This app tests a user on basic triad and four-note spellings of music chords. The goal of the app is to make sure musicians / students of music have a solid grasp of building basic chords which can help with music improvisation as well as songwriting and composition. After the user has typed in the correct note, the border of the input turns green, and red when incorrect.
