## Chord Speller

#### Introduction

**Title**: Chord Speller

This app tests a user on basic triad and four-note spellings of music chords. The goal of the app is to make sure musicians / students of music have a solid grasp of building basic chords which can help with music improvisation as well as songwriting and composition. After the user has typed in the correct note, the border of the input turns green, and red when incorrect.

#### Planning and Workflow

#### Future Features
- add a timer for extra challenge
- add staff with treble or bass clef options
- add inversions
- add a section that allows user to build the scales harmonically by drag/drop chord types in order (i.e. drag major for C, drag minor for Dm, drag a minor for Em, a major for F, etc.)
- add a section to randomly test the various note position of a cord (i.e. what's the 5th of Eb major)
- add a comparative section (i.e. ability to compare major sound with minor sound or major sound with augmented sound etc.)
